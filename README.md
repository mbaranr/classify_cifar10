# CIFAR-10 Classification: End-to-End Deep Learning PyTorch Tutorial

This repository serves as a hands-on tutorial covering the full lifecycle of a deep learning project for [CIFAR-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10) classification using PyTorch.

## Structure

Each topic is split into:
- a markdown guide explaining concepts and design decisions
- multiple Jupyter notebooks demonstrating them in practice

## Entry Point

[`tutorial.md`](tutorial.md) links to each module in the intended order and explains how the pieces fit together.

## Who This Is For

This tutorial is made for:
- students learning practical deep learning
- engineers transitioning from experimentation to production
- anyone looking to explore PyTorch’s full potential
