## Accuracy
Training baseline models, evaluating performance, building modular networks, preventing overfitting, and applying transfer learning.  
[`accuracy.md`](topics/accuracy/accuracy.md)

## Optimization
Improving training with optimizers, learning-rate schedulers, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.  
[`optimization.md`](topics/optimization/optimization.md)

## Interpretability
Understanding model predictions using saliency maps, Grad-CAM, and feature visualizations.  
[`interpretability.md`](topics/interpretability/interpretability.md)

## Efficiency
Understanding performance bottlenecks, data loading efficiency, and gradient accumulation.  
[`efficiency.md`](topics/efficiency/efficiency.md)

## Deployment
Exporting using ONNX and preparing models for real-world inference through pruning and quantization.
